# knos
That name stands for K is Not an OS :)
It's because I use to follow a bunch of tutorials on writing an OS kernel, and almost all of them
use 'k' as prefix in here and there, then I eventually feel tired reading the keyword OS everywhere
around, so I've decided to write something that's not meant to be an OS, nor a 'kernel', rather than
just a collection of codes running in kernel level.

That's all about it.

Please do not take me seriously, it's probably not going to be any kind of famous anyway.

But it is now using mostly QEMU's serial device to output debugging messages, rather than using
'standard' VGA/Text console, which in my opinion should not be used any further (will jot work on
UEFI based machines).
