# knos
That name stands for K is Not an OS :)
It's because I use to follow a bunch of tutorials on writing an OS kernel, and almost all of them
use 'k' as prefix in here and there, then I eventually feel tired reading the keyword OS everywhere
around, so I've decided to write something that's not meant to be an OS, nor a 'kernel', rather than
just a collection of codes running in kernel level.

That's all about it.

Please do not take me seriously, it's probably not going to be any kind of famaous anyway.
